Observations

We can categorize Iris flower species based on the below:

setosa
petal length: 1-2
petal width: 0.1 -0.6
sepal length: 4.25 - 5.75
sepal width: 2.8 -4.4


versicolor
petal length: 3-5
petal width: 1 -1.8
sepal length: 4.8 - 7
sepal width: 2-3.4

virginica
petal length: 4.5 -7
petal width: 1.4 - 2.5
sepal length: 5.5 - 8
sepal width: 2.5-3.75

petal length of the species has good linear relationship with petal width and sepal length

sepal length and petal width have good linear relationship
